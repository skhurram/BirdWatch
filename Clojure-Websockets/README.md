# Birdwatch using Clojure, ClojureScript and Om
This is an **all-Clojure** implementation of the **BirdWatch** application. There is a **book** being written about this application: **[Building a System in Clojure](https://leanpub.com/building-a-system-in-clojure)**

## Building blocks:
Here is a brief overview of the building blocks:

* The server side is organized as a few independent **components** that are wired together by **[@stuartsierra](https://twitter.com/stuartsierra)**'s **[component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component)** library.
* A twitter client on top of **Adam Wynne**'s **[twitter-api](https://github.com/adamwynne/twitter-api)** connects to the **[Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview)** and subscribes to a number of terms.
* The *information grid* or pipes and tubes of the application is provided by **[core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async)**.
* Tweets are persisted into **[ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org)** using **[@ClojureWerkz](https://twitter.com/clojurewerkz)** **[Elastisch](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/elastisch)** client.
* Clients connect over **[WebSockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)** provided by **[@ptaoussanis](https://twitter.com/ptaoussanis)** **[sente](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente)** library.
* Clients can perform **live searches**, where matching new tweets with running searches is done via ElasticSearch's **[Percolator](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-percolate.html)** feature. The client UI is then updated in (near)-real time over the existing WebSockets connection.
* The client UI is built using **[@swannodette](https://twitter.com/swannodette)**'s **[Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om)** library on top of Facebook's **[react](https://github.com/facebook/react)**.

## Installation of MainApp
First of all, **[Leiningen](http://leiningen.org)** must be installed on your system. Then, you need to build the client-side application:

    lein cljsbuild once release
    lein cljsbuild once dev

Alternatively, you can use the following during development to detect file system changes and recompile MUCH FASTER:

    lein cljsbuild auto release
    lein cljsbuild auto dev

You also need **[Bower](http://bower.io)** for managing the client-side dependencies. Once you have it installed, all you need to do is run it once:

    bower install

In the conf.edn, you can specify

* the address under which your installation of **[ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org)** is accessible (default is localhost)
* the index to use in ElasticSearch
* address and port of running instance of Redis (default localhost:6379)

## Installation of TwitterClient
You will need to create a file named twitterconf.edn. You can copy **twitterconf-tpl.edn** as a template. Edit it and fill out the credentials you have obtained from **[dev.twitter.com](dev.twitter.com)**:

      { :consumer-key             "<YOUR API KEY HERE>"
        :consumer-secret          "<YOUR API SECRET HERE>"
        :user-access-token        "<YOUR ACCESS TOKEN HERE>"
        :user-access-token-secret "<YOUR ACCESS TOKEN SECRET HERE>"
        :es-address               "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
        :es-index                 "birdwatch"
        :track                    "clojure,love"
        :tw-check-interval-sec    10
        :tw-restart-wait          60
        :pidfile-name             "twitterclient.pid"
        :redis-host               "127.0.0.1"
        :redis-port               6379}

In the twitterconf.edn, you can specify

* the address under which your installation of **[ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org)** is accessible (default is localhost)
* the index to use in ElasticSearch
* the terms to track in the Streaming API connection with Twitter
* address and port of running instance of Redis (default localhost:6379)

## Usage
Once the steps described above are completed, usage is easy. You can start up the both applications in their respective directories like this:

    lein run

Alternatively, you can use the REPL:

    lein repl
    birdwatch.main=> (alter-var-root #'system component/start)
